# Surgical Skill Assessment in Robot-Assisted Colorectal Surgery
Honours Project (BSc Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Edinburgh)

## Overview
This project investigates whether robot console log-derived Operative Performance Indicators (OPIs) can support automated assessment of technical performance in robot-assisted colorectal cancer surgery. Using MASTERY study data from 41 robot-assisted resections performed by 14 surgeons, task-level OPIs were aggregated per operation step and analysed alongside postoperative outcomes including hospital length of stay and a composite patient-reported condition score derived from quality-of-life questionnaires using principal component analysis (PCA).

## What this project covers
- Workflow characterisation: typical task ordering and variation in task sequences across surgeons
- Visual analytics: workflow variability visualisations (for example task transitions and timeline-style views)
- Outcome associations: identification of task-metric pairs strongly associated with postoperative outcomes
- Prototype feedback reporting: surgeon-personalised feedback report benchmarking key metrics using percentile ranges
- Predictive baselines: supervised regression models trained on selected OPIs to predict outcomes, illustrating feasibility of forecasting recovery metrics from intraoperative behaviour

## Key notes and limitations
The findings support OPIs as interpretable signals linked to patient recovery, while highlighting limitations related to cohort size, missing questionnaire responses, and skewed surgeon case distribution.
